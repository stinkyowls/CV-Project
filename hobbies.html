      <h2>Outside of my professional work, I maintain a range of hobbies that reflect my curiosity, discipline, and enjoyment of both independent and social activities.
is one of my main interests and provides both physical exercise and mental clarity. Regular bike riding helps me stay active, manage stress, and maintain focus, while also encouraging resilience and goal-setting through longer or more challenging routes. It has taught me the value of consistency and gradual improvement, qualities I also apply in my working life.</p>
<P>I have a strong interest in archaeology, particularly in understanding how past societies lived and organised themselves. This hobby has developed my attention to detail, patience, and ability to interpret evidence critically. It also complements my enjoyment of reading, where I regularly explore history, non-fiction, and technical material. Reading allows me to continually expand my knowledge and improve my concentration and communication skills.</p>

<p>Coding is another key interest of mine and reflects my problem-solving mindset. I enjoy learning new programming concepts, experimenting with small projects, and finding logical solutions to practical challenges. This hobby has strengthened my analytical thinking, persistence, and ability to learn independently.</p>

<P>Finally, I value the social aspect of going to the pub, not simply as a leisure activity but as a way to connect with friends and the local community. It provides an opportunity to relax, exchange ideas, and build relationships, reinforcing the importance of balance between work and personal life.</p>
<p>Together, these hobbies demonstrate a combination of physical activity, intellectual curiosity, technical skill, and social engagement, contributing to a well-rounded and motivated approach both personally and professionally.</p></h2>
